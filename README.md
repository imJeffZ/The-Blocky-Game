# The-Blocky-Game

## Introduction
Blocky is a game with simple moves on a simple structure, but like a Rubiks Cube, it is quite challenging to play. The game is played on a randomly-generated game board made of squares of four different colours, such as [this:][https://imgur.com/a/hipE2MD]

Each player has their own goal that they are working towards, such as creating the largest connected "blob" of blue. After each move, the player sees their score, determined by how well they have achieved their goal. The game continues for a certain number of turns, and the player with the highest score at the end is the winner.

## Learning Goals

+ model hierarchical data using trees
+ implement recursive operations on trees (both non-mutating and mutating)
+ convert a tree into a flat, two-dimensional structure
+ use inheritance to design classes according to a common interface
